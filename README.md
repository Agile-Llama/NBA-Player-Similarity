# NBA-Player-Similarity

The idea I wish to explore is how similar (statistically) players from previous NBA generations are to current players.
The NBA is a superstars league and as such i'm going to focus mainly on those superstar players.

Im using a dataset which is found at: https://data.world/jgrosz99/nba-player-data-1978-2016.  
It contains all players who have played in the NBA from the 1977-78 season up to the 2015-16.

For when I reference later I will be breaking the league up into different eras. Anybody who knows anything about basketball and basketball history can tell you how different the game is from today to the early 80s.  
Just as an example, the 2015 GSW took a total of 2217 three point shots. Where as the 85-86 celtics tool 393. (See basketball reference below for stats)

## Questions I want to look into.

I want to not only compare all players to eachother but also answer some specific questions. Things like:
 - Which player is most similiar to Magic Johnson in the modern game.
 - Which player from today is most similar Michael Jordan.
 - The differences between positions in the modern NBA. ie How the role of the big man has changed. How the tradional point guard has changed overtime.
